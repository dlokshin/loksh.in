My great-uncle, Siena, likes to make sure to emphasize that while many things
in the USSR were bad, the anti-semitism was by far the worst (for him).

He and my grandmother decided to go to the movies and took a public bus. As he
stepped off the bus, he extended his hand to my grandmother to guide her descent
off the bus. The woman behind her exclaimed, "Wow! Such a cultured Jew!"
