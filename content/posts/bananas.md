Shortly after my sister was born and about nine months before my parents left
the USSR, my dad's best friend, Misha, took a train
to Moscow, stood in line for seven hours, and purchased six bananas. He kept
three for his family and gave three to my parents, a gift my parents continue
to say they will never be able to repay.

My parents' first stop after leaving the Soviet Union was Austria. They lived
above a small market. My dad says that one day, while looking out the window,
he spotted a schoolgirl walk into the store and walk out with a single banana.
Intrigued, he decided to try the same. He walked into the store, tore off a
single banana from a bunch, and went to pay. The store owner took a few coins,
my dad stepped outside, and then he ate the banana. Giddy with joy, he repeated
this same process a dozen times until he couldn't eat any more bananas. That day,
he had eaten more bananas than he had in his 27 years in the USSR.
