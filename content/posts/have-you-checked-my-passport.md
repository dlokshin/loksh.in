When my dad graduated college, he looked for a job in engineering in any
industry except for the military since he had already set his mind on
immigrating. Working with state secrets would make immigrating impossible.

Because he was Jewish, and engineering jobs were coveted, he was rejected
from every job he applied to. Interviews would go great, then would come the
background check, and he'd be informed that the position was already filled.

Finally, he applied to become a postman. He had gone to a specialized math
high school, competed nationally in physics olympiads, and was happy to take
any job to wait out his application for immigration. Surprisingly, he was given
the job! When he went to fill out his paperwork, he asked his supervisor,
"Are you sure? Do you want to look at my passport?"

"Your passport," replied his manager, "what are you, American?"

My dad started delivering mail the next day.
