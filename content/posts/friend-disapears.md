My grandmother told me that growing up, you had to be very careful what types
of topics you talked about out loud, even with friends or colleagues from
school. "The KGB was everywhere, you never knew who was an informant."

As proof she told me about one night when she was walking to the subway stop
with friends, some close some less close, from medical school. One of them,
(a fellow jew, she was always sure to add) made a joke about Stalin. He didn't
show up to classes the next day. Or any other day, for that matter. They never
saw or heard from him again. He just vanished.
