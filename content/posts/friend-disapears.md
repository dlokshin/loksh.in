My grandmother told me that growing up, you had to be very careful what types
of topics you talked about out loud, even with friends or colleagues from
school. "The KGB was everywhere, you never knew who was an informant."

As proof, she told me about one night when she was walking to a subway stop
with friends, some close, some not, from medical school. One of them
(a fellow Jew, she was always sure to add) made a joke about Stalin. He didn't
show up to classes the next day. Or any other day, for that matter. They never
saw or heard from him again. He just vanished. This would have been in the
late 1940s.
