The week that my parents were set to leave the USSR for America, their families
threw a massive party. My father's best friend, Misha, said to him, "You're
proof that if you put in enough effort, you can get out of any situation." He
was, of course, referencing putting in the effor to escape communism.

Another friend's father steps towards them and gives a counter example. "Tell
me how to get out of this situation," he said. "You're in a german camp, and
the officer tells all the men to take off their pants. Everyone with a
circumcision gets a bullet to the head. How do you get out of that situation?"

It was a story from his childhood in the Ukraine. He survived because his
parents had been too poor to pay for a circumcision.
