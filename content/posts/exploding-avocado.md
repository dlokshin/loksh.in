My parent's first stop in America was Phoenix Arizona. They were
sponsored by the local jewish community. Upon arrival, my parents were given a
gift basket with food, diapers, and other items to help make their transition
to a new country easier.

One of the items was an avocado. My parents had never heard of, much less seen,
an avocado. My mom decided it was a rotten potato. Not one for waste, she
decided to boil it for dinner (being a potato and all). The avocado exploded
in the pot and all over the small kitchen.

That's how my parents learned about avocados.
