title: bitcoin
subtitle: I was first introduced to bitcoin by a friend in 2011 who said
it was magical internet money. We experimented with it like a toy. I didn't
read the bitcoin whitepaper until a few years later. I think that free
civilization will look back on it's publication and content in a similar way
to the way we regard the federalist papers. I think that historically it will
be more important. Below are links worth reading to start understanding
bitcoin.
